# setupRopstar

Credits
-------
All the credits for the first part of this script (setup of the libc-database) goes to my friend Maxxvw. I don't take any credits on this part !

Why
---
The installation of the Ropstar tool by XCT doesn't work properly with the libc-database project. There are problems of symbolic links by default. This script is here to correctly setup the projects.

I will improve this script after to setup all the Ropstar project with ROPGadget and the libc-database with only one command.
